    ZooKeeper-based implementations of the {@link java.util.concurrent.locks} libraries.
</p>

<p>
    Utility classes that are commonly useful in distributed, concurrent programming. This package contains
standard implementations of the {@link java.util.concurrent.locks} libraries using ZooKeeper, as well as a few
basic utilities which make creating and using such implementations easier. Here are brief descriptions of the main
components.

<p>
    <b>Implementations.</b> {@link org.menagerie.locks.ReentrantZkLock} provides the distributed equivalent of
    {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock}. It adheres to the {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock} interface,
    and support full reentrancy. {@link org.menagerie.locks.ReentrantZkReadWriteLock} provides the distributed equivalent
    of {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock}, supporting fully reentrant read and write locks.
